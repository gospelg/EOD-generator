# EOD-generator
Creates end of day reports so I don't have to...

My boss makes me fill out a report anytime I go onsite, logging travel times, mileages, and other statistics. He likes it in a 
very certain format. This is a simple program to generate reports in this particular style, and prevents me from having to punch 
stuff in on a calculator.

Here is an example EOD (end of day report)


#Example Eod
Start Miles: 119,641
End Miles: 119,666
TOTAL: 25

From shop to Ellison house: 119,641 - 119,653 (12 miles) 12:12 - 12:32 (20 minutes) <- travel. From 12:32 - 16:14 (3 hours 42 minutes) <- onsite.

Performed general maintenance on 2 pc's.

From Ellison house to shop: 119,653 - 119,666 (13 miles) 16:14 - 16:37 (23 minutes) <- travel.

As of version one, this program can query for user input and generate a simple report such as this, but many times I have to make
several trips, sometimes from one site to the next without coming back to the shop.
